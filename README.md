# Goodwill After-Hours Donation System

This project implements an automated donation intake system designed for Goodwill-style donation boxes. The system uses a Raspberry Pi to coordinate ultrasonic distance sensing, PIR-based safety detection, motorized doors, solenoid locks, a conveyor belt, and RGBW NeoPixel status indicators. A live Flask-based web interface provides real-time user-friendly status updates during the donation process.

This system was developed as part of the Senior Design course in Mechanical Engineering at Tufts University by Ariana Olivares, Nathan Henderson and Sol Brizuela.
